The expert trek leaders who have lead several dbatches of this trek for Mischief Treks recommend to visit here only when the trees are lush green and creating a dense cover over the land which makes a person feel as if its dark outside. The name Andharban is derived from the illusion of darkness created by dense trees that block the sunlight completely. Andharban is located in Tamhini Ghat of Raidad District in Maharashtra.",
